In the modern world, we find ourselves overwhelmed with an overabundance of content on a daily basis. Furthermore, staying on top of the latest videos, podcasts, and interviews could be an uphill task, especially in fields such as AI. 

To make matters easier, we introduce to you Youtube Summarizer, a tool designed to provide summarized recaps of your favorite videos and channels. The features of our App include:

1. **Video Summary**: Generate a concise summary of videos.
2. **Keyword Specific Summary**:
   - Enter a specific keyword such as "conflict" to obtain a targeted summary focused on that topic.
   - Ideal when a video covers multiple topics of interest like "war", "AGI", "Psychology"; the app will produce summaries relevant to each topic.
3. **Channel Summary**: If you don't have time to watch every video from your favorite channel, use our tool to generate a summary of all videos released in the past few weeks across multiple channels. A handy way to stay updated with whatâ€™s interesting.
4. **Keyword Specific Channel Summary**: Tailor your channel summary based on specific topics of interest. For instance, if you are interested in "market fluctuation", get a precise summary of videos discussing this topic over the past weeks. Save your time and benefit from focused viewing.

### Choosing between GPT4 and GPT3.5:

The summarization quality is significantly influenced by the Language Learning Model (LLM) choice:

- GPT3.5 provides you with fast but succinct information. 
- For a more comprehensive and detailed summary, resort to GPT-4. However, consider slower processing due to usage rate limits.
