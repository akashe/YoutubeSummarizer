[Click here to try it out!](https://youtubebuddy.streamlit.app/)

Get information from youtube videos the way you want it.

### Community tokens:
To allow people try out youtubebuddy we allow open access worth 2.5$ compute costs daily. Once the community tokens are exhausted, users can use their own personal OpenAI access keys.
If you like the app, consider [buying us a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/akashe). This would help us cover compute costs.


### Steps to Run the App Locally

Running the app locally involves the following steps:

1. [Set up a Google cloud project in Google workspaces.](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/get-started)
2. [Turn on Youtube Data API v3 for your Google project.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN8WwVQTWYk)
3. [Create OAuth configuration for your project.](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent)
4. [Generate access credentials for your Google cloud project.](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials)
5. [Download 'credentials.json' from your project and keep it locally.](https://techiejackieblogs.com/how-to-create-google-mail-api-credentials-json/)
6. Execute 'streamlit run youtube_summarizer/chatbot.py'.
7. On initial execution, authenticate the project via a Gmail account.
8. This will locally save a 'token.json' file, containing the access token for future access without having to authenticate again.
9. Open the streamlit app in UI and start interacting via chat.
